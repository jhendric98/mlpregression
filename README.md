# mlpregression

This project implements an MLP regression for a regression prediction of mean home value on the Boston Home training dataset. The model is implemented and trained in Jupyter notebooks then saved to model.py (the model) and model.h5 (trained weights).

The model is implemented for prediction in server.py which is built into a Docker image with the Dockerfile. This can image can be implemented multiple times behind a load balancer in Kubernetes.


I'll be updated further instructions.
